# Overview

This is a simple game that you collect flies as a frog and try to avoid colliding with the saw blades that are drawn towards you. You control the frog with your mouse.

I wrote this software to try out Python arcade and better understand it. Overall it is a great system that can be very powerful and I look forward to learning more from it.
Below is the demo video of the program
